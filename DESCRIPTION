Description: Categorization and scoring of injury severity typically involves
    trained personnel with access to injured persons or their medical records. 'icdpicr' contains a function
    that provides automated calculation of Abbreviated Injury Scale ('AIS') and Injury Severity Score ('ISS')
    from International Classification of Diseases ('ICD') codes and may be a useful substitute to manual injury 
    severity scoring. 'ICDPIC' was originally developed in 'Stata', and 'icdpicr' is an open-access update 
    that accepts both 'ICD-9' and 'ICD-10' codes.
